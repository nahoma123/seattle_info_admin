                <h2>Data Deletion and Retention</h2>
                <p>Upon receiving a deletion request through the app or via email, we will permanently delete your account and associated personal data. Hereâ€™s what that includes:</p>

                    <li><strong>What is deleted:</strong>

                            <li>Your primary account credentials (e.g., email, username, and authentication provider details).</li>
                            <li>Your user profile information (e.g., name, profile picture).</li>
                            <li>Any user-generated content you have created that is tied to your account.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What may be retained:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We may retain certain data for a limited period (typically up to 90 days) for legitimate business purposes, such as security, fraud prevention, or to comply with legal obligations.</li>
                            <li>Any data that has been fully anonymized and cannot be linked back to you may be kept for statistical or analytical purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The deletion process will begin immediately after your request is confirmed and will be completed within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
